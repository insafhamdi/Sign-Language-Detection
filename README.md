# Sign-Language-Translator
This project aims to develop a cutting-edge system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect sign language from images and convert it into audio, and vice versa, thus facilitating seamless communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language.
